The application is primarily created as BMI(BODY MASS INDEX)calculator.
The application gets the initial data from user consist of HEIGHT(inches) and WEIGHT(pounds).

the application uses 6 primary component:
  1. result output text(txtResult)
  2. height input label(lblHeight)
  3. height input text(txtHeight)
  4. weight input label(lblWeight)
  5. weight input text(txtWeight)
  6. calculate button(btnCalculate)

the application uses 5 variable as temporary data.

*heightVal
  this corresponds to the initial data that the user input on (txtHeight) textbox.
  
*weightVal
  this corresponds to the initial data that the user input on (txtWeight) textbox.

*convertedHeightVal
  this corresponds to the converted value of (txtHeight).
    (convertedHeightVal = heightVal * heightVal)
    
*calculatedHeightWeightVal
  this variable corresponds to the initial calculated value of (weightVal) and (convertedHeightVal).
    (calculatedHeightWeightVal = weightVal / convertedHeightVal)
    
*result
  this variable correspons to the final calculation of (calculatedHeightweightVal) converted to final result.
    (result = calculatedHeightWeightVal * 703)
      the number (703) is a default value for body mass index calculation if using (inches) and (pounds)
